Eat at the Boat Quay</h5>\\n\\n<p>Boat Quay is the place to go for dining and entertainment. The alfresco pubs and restaurants make Boat Quay ideal for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Try Wakanui for quality Japanese steak cooked over a white oak fire, or Kinara for reasonably priced North Indian cuisine.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. See the supertrees at Gardens by the Bay</h5>\\n\\n<p>This urban landscaping project is a series of towering metal “supertrees.” There are roughly 200 species of orchids, ferns, and other tropical plants coating their structure. It’s free to walk through the outdoor gardens, but you have to pay for the canopy walk (which is worth doing!) as well as for the stunning <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/gardens-by-the-bay-l5785/singapore-gardens-by-the-bay-admission-e-ticket-t289680/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;cmp=TTD-Singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Flower Dome and Cloud Forest biodomes</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Hang out (and party) on Sentosa</h5>\\n\\n<p>This little island is home to a nighttime light show on the beach and a host of bars, restaurants, and beaches to enjoy. Hang out at Bora Bora Beach Bar or splash out and <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/singapore-cable-car-l88567/singapore-cable-car-skypass-t112639/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">try the cable car</a> sky dining experience (it isn’t cheap). You can get to Sentosa via the Sentosa Express train. Entering on foot/bicycle is free.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Tour the Singapore Zoo</h5>\\n\\n<p>Spanning 70 acres, <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/singapore-zoo-l2721/one-day-ticket-and-tram-ride-t66127/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;cmp=TTD-Singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the Singapore Zoo</a> is massive, boasting over 3,600 mammals, birds, and reptiles. There are lions, tigers, sun bears, Komodo dragons, primates, and much more! The zoo offers a night safari featuring over 900 different nocturnal animals (41% are endangered). Admission for daytime is slightly less than for the night safari.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Hang with the Merlions</h5>\\n\\n<p>The Merlion is Singapore’s mascot and has the head of a lion and the body of a fish. The original statute (and most impressive Merlion) can be found in Merlion Park, but the 37-meter-tall (121-foot) replica on Sentosa is also pretty cool to see. There is no entrance fee for Merlion Park. The park isn’t huge but it’s worth a little visit and photo opportunity. </p></div></div>\\n</div></div><p data-gyg-widget=\"auto\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"LLKQJ38\"> </p><div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6850_32b362-62 alignnone wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\" id=\"seedo\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6850_9774f6-be\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\"><p class=\"gb-container gb-container-7d671ee0 heading-line\" id=\"section-title\">\\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading6850_9862eb-8b wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\" data-kb-block=\"kb-adv-heading6850_9862eb-8b\">Other Things to See and Do in Singapore</h3>\\n</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Admire Thian Hock Keng Temple</h5>\\n\\n<p>Thian Hock Keng (Palace of Heavenly Happiness) is one of the most photogenic buildings in Singapore. The temple originated as a small building that served the local Chinese population. It was expanded in 1840 and made from the finest materials available at the time, paid for by years of donations from the local community. It’s the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore, dedicated to Mazu, the Goddess of the Sea (Chinese immigrants came here to ask for safe passage before leaving to cross the South China Sea). The temple was designated as a national monument in 1973. Admission is free.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Explore Bukit Timah Nature Reserve</h5>\\n\\n<p>Bukit Timah, located within Singapore’s only remaining stretch of rainforest, is the country’s premier eco-tourism attraction. On the hiking and biking trails, you’ll be able to get up close to the macaques, squirrels, flying lemurs, and various species of birds. The reserve covers over 400 acres and is 30 minutes from the city center. It’s open daily from 7am to 7pm. The weekends get really busy, so come during the week if you want to avoid the crowds.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Wander around Chinatown</h5>\\n\\n<p>Chinatown encompasses two square kilometers of traditional Chinese life, nestled beside the modern Central Business District. This remains the place to get a real sense of Chinese culture within Singapore. The streets are filled with temples, craft shops, stalls, and restaurants and are a great place to pick up a bargain. Head down Chinatown Food Street to find some <em>char kway teow</em> (stir-fried noodles) or grilled meats. If you can, eat at Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle (aka Hawker Chan), the world’s most affordable Michelin-starred restaurant. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is another Michelin-starred hawker stall worth a visit. Like Hawker Chan’s, it’s located in the Maxwell Hawker Center. You can also <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/singapore-l170/unesco-hawker-culture-chinatown-food-tasting-tour-t684974/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">take a guided food tour</a> to explore the area. </p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Eat hawker food</h5>\\n\\n<p>Singapore’s hawker food scene is one of the best in the world. It was recognized by Michelin in 2016 with the world’s first street food Michelin star and by UNESCO in 2020 with Cultural Heritage status. Whether you go to Newton Food Center (of Crazy Rich Asian fame), to the Old Airport Hawker (many locals’ favorite), or to one of the other 103 centers across the island, you won’t be disappointed and you can grab a cheap meal surrounded by locals. Don’t miss the chili crab, satay, dim sum (dumplings), or nasi lemak (fried chicken with coconut rice). If you’re not sure where to go or what to eat, <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/singapore-l170/singapore-local-food-tasting-tour-t418329/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;cmp=TTD-Singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">take a guided food tour!</a></p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Take a trip to Pulau Ubin</h5>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/pulau-ubin-l1710/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;cmp=TTD-Singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">This island</a> lies off the northeastern coast. It’s incredibly different from the modern city; locals still use a diesel generator for electricity and fetch water from wells. Rent a bike and explore the sights, villages, and beaches of this island. To get there, hop on a bumboat from the Changi Point Ferry Terminal, which takes 10-15 minutes. There are no fixed departure times — just line up and wait. Very few tourists make it out this way; it’s one of the most off-the-beaten-path things you can do here.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Relax in the Singapore Botanic Gardens</h5>\\n\\n<p>The Botanic Gardens lie close to the city and consist of 128 acres of gardens and forest. Founded in 1859, the main attraction is the National Orchid Garden, home to over 1,000 species of orchids. There is also a ginger garden, a rainforest, and various streams and waterfalls to explore. The Botanic Gardens are Singapore’s first UNESCO World Heritage site (and the only tropical botanic garden on UNESCO’s World Heritage List). It’s open daily from 5am to 12am, and admission is free to everything except the <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/singapore-botanic-gardens-l4047/singapore-national-orchid-garden-entry-tickets-t377679/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;utm_medium=online_publisher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Orchid Garden</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Eat in Little India</h5>\\n\\n<p>No trip to Singapore is complete without a visit to Little India, where you can get amazing, cheap, and delicious food, fresh vegetables, snacks, and souvenirs. Seek out local favorites like <em>roti prata</em> (pancakes) and <em>teh tarik</em> (“pulled” tea). Make sure you stop off at the Tekka Center, a hawker center with Indian clothing, groceries, and food. The food here is cheap and delicious and makes for an authentic Little India experience.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Learn about Singapore’s History</h5>\\n\\n<p>For a more cultural experience, visit the former British naval base of Fort Siloso located on Sentosa. It’s a decommissioned coastal artillery battery the only preserved fort on the coast of Singapore, providing a fantastic look into the city-state’s complicated history. You’ll get to see the coastal guns and the remains of tunnels under the fort. It’s a well-constructed, interactive attraction. Entrance is free.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Visit Sri Mariamman Temple</h5>\\n\\n<p>This extremely colorful, ornate temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore, built in 1827 in Chinatown. It was constructed in what is known as the Dravidian style and is devoted to the goddess Mariamman, known for curing illnesses and diseases. During the post-war colonial period, it was a hub for community activities and was even the Registry of Marriages for Hindus. Admission is free.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Watch a free concert</h5>\\n\\n<p>The Singapore Symphony Orchestra hosts various free concerts at different venues around the country. They are really good and it’s a fun cultural activity to do. Just <a href=\"https://www.sso.org.sg/free-concerts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check their website</a> for details and their most current schedule.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Visit the MacRitchie Reservoir Park</h5>\\n\\n<p>MacRitchie Reservoir is Singapore’s oldest reservoir, dating back to 1868. Today, this beautiful and lush city park is a relaxing place to spend an afternoon. Walk the 8-kilometer (5-mile) treetop hike, with bridges suspended high above the forest floor, where you might see long-tailed macaque monkeys, squirrels, monitor lizards, owls, and even flying lemurs. In addition to the TreeTop Walk, there’s also a network of walking trails. Admission is free.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Visit the National Museum of Singapore</h5>\\n\\n<p>First opened in 1849, <a href=\"https://www.getyourguide.com/national-gallery-singapore-l19692/national-gallery-singapore-t68656/?partner_id=LLKQJ38&amp;cmp=TTD-Singapore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this is the oldest museum in Singapore</a>. Learn about the country’s history, culture, and people through the various permanent and temporary exhibitions. There are gold ornaments, 18th-century drawings and artwork, the mace used by King George VI when he declared Singapore a city in 1951, and the Singapore Stone (an indecipherable stone with inscriptions from the 10th century). </p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Admire the street art</h5>\\n\\n<p>Singapore has some really incredible street art to admire. While none of it is spontaneous (unauthorized graffiti is illegal), it can be found all over the island. Yip Yew Chong is probably the best-known artist as he has murals everywhere from Chinatown to the East Coast. His images depict scenes from days gone by and range from small pictures to entire walls. Kampong Glam, Chinatown, and Little India all have masses of art to look at, as does the east coast, but you can find it on random buildings in most areas. Take a walking tour if you want more detail, or Art Walk Singapore has three self-guided walks outlined on their website.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Marvel at the rain vortex in Jewel</h5>\\n\\n<p>Located adjacent to Changi International Airport, Jewel Mall is home to the world’s tallest indoor waterfall. Cascading from the roof, the water falls seven stories (around 130 feet) to the basement through a huge tiered garden. At night it is lit up for a light and music show. There’s more to do at Jewel if you have time including two mazes, a canopy bridge, sky nets, slides, and a topiary walk. It’s free to see the rain vortex and prices vary for each for the other activities. You can get bundles that work out cheaper.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Explore Kampong Glam</h5>\\n\\n<p>Also known by its most popular street, Haji Lane, and as the Arab Quarter, Kampong Glam is one of Singapore’s oldest neighborhoods. The shophouses here are now stores selling textiles, rugs, and Turkish homewares such as dishes and glass lamps. There are some great Arabic restaurants around here all under the shadow of the enormous golden-domed Sultan Mosque. There’s some street art around here and Haji Lane has some cool eclectic shops by day and a buzzing nightlife with outdoor live music by night. If you have time, check out the Malay Heritage Center.</p>\\n\\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Get spooked at Haw Par Villa</h5>\\n\\n<p>Hands down the quirkiest thing you can do or see in Singapore, Haw Par Villa is a huge outdoor art gallery. It was built in 1937 by Aw Boon Haw, a millionaire philanthropist one of the men behind Tiger Balm, for his younger brother. Once a theme park for locals, Haw Par Villa was also used as an observation point by the Japanese army during World War II. It’s filled with dioramas depicting Chinese mythology and has recently reopened after a 9-month refurbishment and renovation project. Entry to the grounds is free but the museum — called Hell’s Museum as it includes an exhibit depicting the 10 Courts of Hell.</p>\\n\\n<p data-gyg-widget=\"auto\" data-gyg-partner-id=\"LLKQJ38\"> </p></div></div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6850_019ff4-c2 alignnone wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\" id=\"safe\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6850_637a24-b1\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\"><p class=\"gb-container gb-container-b68a4ab2 heading-line\" id=\"section-title\">\\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading6850_1d9616-f8 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\" data-kb-block=\"kb-adv-heading6850_1d9616-f8\">How to Stay Safe in Singapore</h3>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Singapore is an incredibly safe place to backpack and travel. Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world (it’s currently the 11th safest country) and you aren’t going to encounter really any problems here. Crime is very, very rare and usually only happens when drugs are involved. </p>\\n\\n<p>Solo female travelers should generally feel safe here. However, it’s always a good idea to be aware of your surroundings and follow standard safety precautions like never leaving your drink unattended at the bar, walking in unlit places alone at night, etc. If you want specific information about Singapore, there are a number of incredible solo female travel blogs that can provide tips that I can’t.</p>\\n\\n<p>Be aware that penalties for breaking the law here are stiff. For example, you’ll be fined up to 1,000 SGD for things like littering, spitting, and smoking in public. Singapore is also notoriously strict on drugs. If you’re caught even with marijuana in your system you could do jail time. In short, say no to drugs here!</p>\\n\\n<p>If you experience an emergency, dial 999 for assistance.</p>\\n\\n<p>Always trust your gut instinct and make copies of your personal documents, including your passport and ID. </p>\\n\\n<p>If you don’t do it at home, don’t do it when you’re in Singapore. Follow that rule and you’ll be fine.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most important piece of advice I can offer is to purchase good travel insurance. Travel insurance will protect you against illness, injury, theft, and cancellations. It’s comprehensive protection in case anything goes wrong. I never go on a trip without it as I’ve had to use it many times in the past.

Here are some ways you can save money during your visit:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Avoid bottled water</strong> – The tap water here is perfectly fine to drink, so avoid buying water and just refill your bottle. It will save you money and it’s better for the environment! <a href=\"https://lifestraw.xyibsh.net/B0AY14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LifeStraw</a> is my go-to brand as their bottles have built-in filters to ensure your water is always clean and safe.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Take public transit</strong> – Singapore’s public transit system is fast and efficient, making it the best way to get around. Unlimited travel on public transport is 17 SGD per day with a Singapore Tourist Pass. If you’re staying a few days, the pass gets cheaper per day, as a two-day pass is 24 SGD and a three-day pass is 29 SGD.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Buy a sightseeing pass</strong> – GoCity and Klook both offer sightseeing passes for Singapore that bundle together popular attractions for less than paying each entrance fee individually. Check them both to see which is the best for your trip. Prices start at 83 SGD. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Eat on Smith Street</strong> – The stalls here offer food for less than 6 SGD and are a great place to sample local snacks.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Eat cheap</strong> – Save money on food by eating in Little India, Chinatown, or the hawker stalls throughout the city. Meals in these places cost only a few dollars and are some of the tastiest around!</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Stay with a local</strong> – Use <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-crush-it-on-couchsurfing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Couchsurfing</a> to stay with a local for free. You’ll not only save money but you’ll get to connect with someone who can share their insider tips and advice.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Reedeem hotel points</strong> – Make sure you sign up for hotel credit cards and use those points to cover accommodations when you travel. Most cards come with at least 1-2 nights free, which can help lower your costs. <a href=\"https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/points-miles-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">This post</a> will help you get started with the basics so you can start earning points today and have plenty for your trip.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Stick to happy hour</strong> – Alcohol is expensive in Singapore, so limit your drinking to save money. If you do plan on drinking, stick to the happy hours.</p></div></div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6850_fd318b-ca alignnone wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\" id=\"getaround\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6850_7208c7-25\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\"><p class=\"gb-container gb-container-4f458871 heading-line\" id=\"section-title\">\\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading6850_e30ad7-d7 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\" data-kb-block=\"kb-adv-heading6850_e30ad7-d7\">How to Get Around in Singapore</h3>\\n</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\\'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\\'%20viewBox=\\'0%200%202120%20891\\'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"The skyline of urban Singapore, featuring skyscrapers all lit up at night\" data-lazy-src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2022/singaporeguide3.jpeg\"></figure>\\n\\n<p><strong>Public transportation</strong> – Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is the fastest way to get around. The rail network is extensive, so most of the city’s main attractions are within walking distance to an MRT station. Most trips cost around 4 SGD, but you can buy a Singapore Tourist Pass with unlimited travel for one day for 17 SGD, two days for 24 SGD, or three days for 29 SGD. Note: there is a 10 SGD USD deposit that’s returned if you return the card five days after purchasing it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Like the MRT, Singapore’s bus system is extensive and efficient. You can use your Singapore Tourist Pass on the buses as well. You can also pay with cash, but it has to be the exact change. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Trishaws</strong> – Trishaws (like rickshaws) are less popular these days in Singapore, and now they’re largely used for guided tours that cost around 40 SGD for a 30-minute run. <a href=\"https://www.trishawuncle.com.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trishaw Uncle</a> is the only licensed trishaw tour operator in the city, offering various guided tours by trishaw.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Taxi</strong> – Taxis are comfortable and convenient, but they’re not cheap! All cabs are metered, but there might be surcharges depending on the company and where you’re going. For example, if you’re hiring a taxi from midnight to 6am there is a 50% surcharge on the total metered cost, while rides in the mornings and evenings carry a 25% surcharge. Prices start at 4.40 SGD and then increase by 0.26 SGD every 400 meters. Skip them if you can!</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Bike</strong> – Singapore is a cycle-friendly city, with bike paths covering the entire island. A rental The Bicycle Hut costs 35 SGD per day or 15 SGD for a three-hour rental. You can also use the bike-sharing app, SG Bikes, which costs 1 SGD for the first 30 minutes, and then 0.03 SGD/minute.</p></div></div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6850_04e61e-76 alignnone wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\" id=\"when\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6850_9ee274-a4\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\"><p class=\"gb-container gb-container-92d7936f heading-line\" id=\"section-title\">\\n<h3 class=\"kt-adv-heading6850_be3dc2-b3 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\" data-kb-block=\"kb-adv-heading6850_be3dc2-b3\">When to Go to Singapore</h3>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>It’s always a good time to visit Singapore! The island is warm year-round with a tropical climate that boasts daily temperatures in the high 20s°C (80s°F). December to June is the busiest time to visit, especially during the Chinese New Year. February-April is the driest period with the most sunshine and least amount of rain.</p>\\n\\n<p>Monsoons occur between December and March, with December usually being the rainiest month. The weather is windy, cloudy, and humid.</p>\\n\\n<p>Late summer and early fall (July to October) are also a good time to visit if you’re hoping to avoid all the tourist traffic. The weather is still pleasant, averaging around 30°C (87°F) each day, and accommodation might be a bit cheaper during this time as well.</p></div></div>\\n</div></div><div class=\"guide-block resources-block\"><h3 id=\"book\"><span>Singapore Travel Guide: The Best Booking Resources</span></h3><p>These are my favorite companies to use when I travel.
